# K-means-Clustering-on-Cancer-dataset
**Problem Description**

The problem is to understand the clustering techniques used for a K-Means algorithm using the cancer dataset. K-Means algorithm
can be trained on numerous parameters. In this notebook, the optimal parameters are chosen and the performance is visualised.
